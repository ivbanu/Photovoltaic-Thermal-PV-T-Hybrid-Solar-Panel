Photovoltaic Thermal (PV/T) Hybrid Solar Panel

This file psesents a detailed simulation model of photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) hybrid solar panel system.
The model is developed in Matlab®/Simulink® environment.
This implementation models the cogeneration of electricity and heat using a hybrid PV/T solar panel.
The generated heat is transferred to water for household consumption.
